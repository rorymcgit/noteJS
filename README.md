# noteJS

```
As a programmer,
So I can find the one I want,
I can see a list of my notes, where each note is abbreviated to the first 20 characters.
```

```
As a programmer,
So I can record something I need to remember,
I can create a new note.
```


```
As a programmer,
So I can see all the information in the note,
I can see the full text of an individual note on its own page.
